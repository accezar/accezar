### Hi there, I'm Anna ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curius developer with > 10 years of experience with UI Design and coding. I had the opportunity to work on different types of projects (Web/Mobile/CLI) and learn new ways of building things, also discover how different tools and platforms interact.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a GitHub app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about IaC, CI/CD and DX tools.
