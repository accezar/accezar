### Hi there, I'm Anna ðŸ‘‹

I'm a curious developer with > 10 years of experience with UI Design and front-end engineering. I had the opportunity to work on different projects - such as Web, Mobile, and CLI - and learn different ways of building things.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a GitHub app.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about IaC, CI/CD and DX tools.
