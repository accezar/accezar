I'm a curious developer with > 10 years of experience with web development and front-end engineering. I had the opportunity to work on different projects - such as Web, Mobile, and CLI - and learn different ways of building things.

- Studing for AWS Solutions Architect Certification.
- Structuring CI with Probot and Github Actions.

- Taking French / English classes.
- Studing Node and Python microservices.
