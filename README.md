I'm a curious developer with > 10 years of experience with web development and front-end engineering. I had the opportunity to work on different projects - such as Web, Mobile, and CLI - and learn different ways of building things. Currently, I work at @madeiramadeirabr, acting as a specialist for the architecture team.
